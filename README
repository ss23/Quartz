PHP Bot utilizing IPC

For now, only the listener is semi-functional, but it should give an idea of how a receiver would attach and handle messages.

Currently, the only problem I can forsee is that it's a queue, once you read a message, it's removed from the queue. I could work around this by establishing a heirachy of recievers, or make every receiver enter a message into the queue after receiving it.
